2021-Aug-31: 15m: Sorting through the email names and transferring them in along with their goals

2021-Aug-31: 2h 30m: I originally wrote 2 different codes then combined them into one. One was super simple, enter a name and it spits out whatever but it had no other features and
                 also didn't look very appealing. The other one had the same beginning where you could choose a number to pick what option you want but instead you entered their
                 name and their goals rather than entering their name and seeing their goals

2021-Aug-31: 1h: Figuring out Github, writing a ReadME, making the video, and transferring everything over. Was struggling for a bit but I think I've got it down now

2021-Aug-31: 45m: Cleaning the code up (including what it prints), trying to make it look nicer and not all crushed together where it is ugly to look at

2021-Aug-31: 30m: I was trying different things out such as removing the brackets and quotes when printing the list of names but it either would mess something else up and 
                 work or not work

2021-Aug-31: 1h: I spent here looking back at previous code I have and reviewing everything over to make sure I understood it. I tried taking certain factors from some and
                 implementing them here
